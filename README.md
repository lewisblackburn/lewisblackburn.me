## 🔨 Requirements

-   Node, recommended `20.x`
-   pnpm, recommended `8.14.0`

## 👋 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally on your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lewisblackburn/lewisblackburn.me.git
cd lewisblackburn.me
pnpm install
```

Create a `.env.local` file based on the provided `.env.example` file and fill in the necessary variables.

OR you can skip this by modifying `apps/web/src/env.ts`:

```ts
export const env = createEnv({
    skipValidation: true,

    server: {
        // ...
    },
})
```

You may notice that some functionalities will not work properly. But it's okay for learning.

To run the app in development mode:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The app will be available at `localhost:3000`.
